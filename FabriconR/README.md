# Fabricon R: Report Promotion Across Environments

> Fabricon R is an extension that can be used with [Fabricon 2](../Fabricon2/README.md), [Fabricon 3](../Fabricon3/README.md) or [Fabricon 4](../Fabricon4/README.md). Use of Fabricon 3 with Fabricon R extension may be referred to as Fabricon 3R and so on.

Teams building Power BI reports on Microsoft Fabric face a multi-layered promotion challenge when moving reports from development to production. Git integration causes `logicalId` conflicts, deployment pipelines assign different `reportId` GUIDs per stage, and hardcoded embed URLs break on promotion. A common workaround is to use a single shared workspace for reports, sacrificing environment isolation.

> Fabricon recommends treating reports and semantic models as data artifacts, not code artifacts. They belong in Data workspaces, not in Git-controlled Code workspaces.

Reports and semantic models are tightly coupled to the lakehouses they read from, not to the notebooks that populate those lakehouses. By placing them in Data workspaces, they are promoted via [Fabric Deployment Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/deployment-pipelines/intro-to-deployment-pipelines) rather than Git, eliminating logicalId conflicts entirely.

## 1. Workspace Structure

Building on [Fabricon 3](../Fabricon3/README.md), which already separates code and data into different workspaces:

| Workspace | Contents | Source Control | Promotion Method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CRM-Dev` | Notebooks, pipelines, DevOps notebook | Git (`develop` branch) | PR merge → `CRM-Prod` |
| `CRM-Prod` | Notebooks, pipelines, DevOps notebook | Git (`main` branch) | N/A |
| `CRM-Data-Dev` | Lakehouses, semantic models, reports | None | Deployment Pipeline → |
| `CRM-Data-Prod` | Lakehouses, semantic models, reports | None | ← Deployment Pipeline target |

> Reports and semantic models live in Data workspaces. This eliminates logicalId conflicts because reports never touch Git.

> When using [Fabricon 5](../Fabricon5/README.md), `CRM-Prod` has no Git connection and its promotion method is the promotion pipeline.

With Fabricon R, the Reports folder moves from the Code workspace to the Data workspace:

```text
Code Workspace (CRM-Dev / CRM-Prod)
├── 📁 Archive
├── 📁 Configuration
├── 📁 Exploration
├── 📁 Pipeline
├── 📁 Tests
└── 📓 Readme

Data Workspace (CRM-Data-Dev / CRM-Data-Prod)
├── 📁 Reports
├── 🗄️ CRMBronze Lakehouse
├── 🗄️ CRMSilver Lakehouse
└── 🗄️ CRMGold Lakehouse
```

> Lakehouse names do not support dashes. Use PascalCase (e.g., CRMBronze). For the Gold layer, both CRM and CRMGold are valid since Gold is the externally facing layer.

## 2. Code Promotion via Git

Notebooks and pipelines are promoted via Git, following the branching strategy from [Fabricon 2 - Source Control](../Fabricon2/README.md#source-control):

- Feature branch → PR → `develop` branch (syncs to `CRM-Dev`)
- `develop` → PR → `main` branch (syncs to `CRM-Prod`)

> When using [Fabricon 5](../Fabricon5/README.md), the second step is replaced by the promotion pipeline, and `CRM-Prod` is not linked to a branch.

## 3. Report and Semantic Model Promotion via Deployment Pipeline

Reports and semantic models are promoted using a [Fabric Deployment Pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/deployment-pipelines/intro-to-deployment-pipelines) configured between `CRM-Data-Dev` and `CRM-Data-Prod`.

> Fabricon recommends that items are initially created in `CRM-Data-Dev` and first deployed through the pipeline to establish pairing. Once paired, subsequent deployments update the paired items in `CRM-Data-Prod`.

Important behaviors of deployment pipelines:

- **Lakehouse data is preserved.** Deployment pipelines copy metadata only; tables and files in the target workspace are never overwritten.
- **Shortcuts are overwritten.** The pipeline takes the source workspace's shortcut definitions and replaces the target's. Use [Variable Libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/variable-library/variable-library-overview) for environment-specific shortcut targets.
- **Reports get new IDs.** The `reportId` GUID in the target workspace is different from the source. This is expected behavior.

## 4. Post-Deployment Rebind

After the deployment pipeline completes, the DevOps notebook in the Code workspace (`CRM-Prod`) must be executed to rebind items to the correct environment. The DevOps notebook performs three operations:

> [Fabricon 5](../Fabricon5/README.md) runs these same rebind operations automatically as a step of the promotion, so that the result does not depend on somebody remembering to execute the notebook afterwards.

**Semantic model → Prod lakehouse**: Uses [Semantic Link Labs](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs) to update the [Direct Lake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/direct-lake-overview) model's lakehouse connection.

```python
import sempy_labs.directlake as dl

dl.update_direct_lake_model_lakehouse_connection(
    "CrmReports",              # semantic model name
    data_workspace_id,         # target data workspace
    "CRMGold",                 # target lakehouse name
    data_workspace_id          # lakehouse workspace
)
```

**Report → Prod semantic model**: Uses Semantic Link Labs to rebind the report to the semantic model in the Data workspace.

```python
import sempy_labs.report as rpt

rpt.report_rebind(
    "CrmReports",              # report name
    "CrmReports",              # semantic model name
    None,                      # report workspace (None = current)
    data_workspace_id          # semantic model workspace
)
```

**Notebook → Prod lakehouse**: Updates all notebook default lakehouse connections in parallel (existing DevOps notebook functionality, see [Fabricon N - Deployment](../FabriconN/README.md#10-deployment)).

> The DevOps notebook is code and lives in the Git-controlled Code workspace (`CRM-Dev` / `CRM-Prod`), not in the Data workspace. It reaches across to the Data workspace via the `DATA_WORKSPACE_ID` environment variable. See [Fabricon N - Deployment](../FabriconN/README.md#10-deployment) for details on the `Common` notebook pattern.

## 5. Embed URL Strategy

Power BI embed URLs use the following format:

```text
https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/reportEmbed?reportId={reportId}&autoAuth=true&ctid={tenantId}
```

Key observations:

- The `tenantId` is constant across all environments.
- The `reportId` is the only value that differs between Dev and Prod.
- The embed URL does not include a `workspaceId` because the `reportId` alone is globally unique within a tenant.
- The `reportId` in the target workspace is **different** from the source workspace after deployment pipeline promotion.

> Fabricon recommends storing environment-specific `reportId` values in application configuration (e.g., `appsettings.json`).

After a fresh deployment pipeline promotion, update the application configuration with the new Prod `reportId`.

For teams seeking full automation, the `reportId` can be resolved dynamically at runtime using the [Power BI REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/reports/get-reports):

1. Look up the workspace by name: `GET /v1.0/myorg/groups?$filter=name eq 'CRM-Data-Prod'`
2. List reports in the workspace: `GET /v1.0/myorg/groups/{groupId}/reports`
3. Find the report by name and use the `embedUrl` from the response.

This approach eliminates hardcoded `reportId` values entirely.

## 6. What Fabricon R Solves

| Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Git logicalId conflicts | Reports are not in Git |
| Deployment pipeline logicalId conflicts | Pipeline pairing established via initial deploy from Data-Dev |
| Embed URL breaks on promotion | Environment-specific `reportId` in app config |
| Semantic model points to wrong lakehouse after promotion | DevOps notebook rebinds via Semantic Link Labs |
| Report points to wrong semantic model after promotion | DevOps notebook rebinds via `report_rebind()` |
| Code workspace cluttered with report files | Reports live in Data workspace, not Git-controlled |
